This is a PowerShell function to abstract out the logic behind waiting for paths to exist.

This was written to help give [a brief overview](https://ramblingcookiemonster.wordpress.com/2015/02/25/fun-with-github-pester-and-appveyor/) on combining GitHub, Pester, and AppVeyor services, and was used to illustrate [the basics of using GitHub](http://ramblingcookiemonster.github.io/GitHub-For-PowerShell-Projects/)

Contributions would be appreciated!
